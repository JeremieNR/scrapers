{"title": "Morgantown Campus Testing Results by Day", "description": "All University-conducted testing moving forward is focused on symptomatic individuals and sample testing of certain groups, including those living in residence halls, participating in athletics and in performing arts, among others, as necessary. The University does expect the daily percentage of positive COVID-19 tests will increase during symptomatic and sample testing, as these tests are for individuals who have COVID-19 symptoms and groups who are more likely to be at risk of contracting COVID-19.Positive test results are listed by the date that they were reported to WVU by WVU Rapid Development Laboratory, not the date the positive cases were tested. This dashboard should not be used to monitor individual test results. Students, faculty and staff should follow the Return to Campus guidelines to access their individual test results.", "date_scraped": "2021-09-12-22:41:09", "data": [{"Date": "2021-09-09", "Resulted": 187.0, "Positives": 5.0, "% Positive": 2.67}, {"Date": "2021-09-08", "Resulted": 568.0, "Positives": 26.0, "% Positive": 4.58}, {"Date": "2021-09-07", "Resulted": 0.0, "Positives": 0.0, "% Positive": null}, {"Date": "2021-09-06", "Resulted": 0.0, "Positives": 0.0, "% Positive": null}, {"Date": "2021-09-05", "Resulted": 0.0, "Positives": 0.0, "% Positive": null}, {"Date": "2021-09-04", "Resulted": 0.0, "Positives": 0.0, "% Positive": null}, {"Date": "2021-09-03", "Resulted": 465.0, "Positives": 17.0, "% Positive": 3.66}, {"Date": "2021-09-02", "Resulted": 449.0, "Positives": 21.0, "% Positive": 4.68}, {"Date": "2021-09-01", "Resulted": 754.0, "Positives": 36.0, "% Positive": 4.77}, {"Date": "2021-08-31", "Resulted": 0.0, "Positives": 0.0, "% Positive": null}, {"Date": "2021-08-30", "Resulted": 365.0, "Positives": 10.0, "% Positive": 2.74}, {"Date": "2021-08-29", "Resulted": 0.0, "Positives": 0.0, "% Positive": null}, {"Date": "2021-08-28", "Resulted": 0.0, "Positives": 0.0, "% Positive": null}, {"Date": "2021-08-27", "Resulted": 289.0, "Positives": 15.0, "% Positive": 5.19}, {"Date": "2021-08-26", "Resulted": 461.0, "Positives": 28.0, "% Positive": 6.07}, {"Date": "2021-08-25", "Resulted": 253.0, "Positives": 7.0, "% Positive": 2.77}, {"Date": "2021-08-24", "Resulted": 0.0, "Positives": 0.0, "% Positive": null}, {"Date": "2021-08-23", "Resulted": 203.0, "Positives": 6.0, "% Positive": 2.96}, {"Date": "2021-08-22", "Resulted": 0.0, "Positives": 0.0, "% Positive": null}, {"Date": "2021-08-21", "Resulted": 1.0, "Positives": 0.0, "% Positive": 0.0}, {"Date": "2021-08-20", "Resulted": 434.0, "Positives": 10.0, "% Positive": 2.3}, {"Date": "2021-08-19", "Resulted": 668.0, "Positives": 10.0, "% Positive": 1.5}, {"Date": "2021-08-18", "Resulted": 138.0, "Positives": 1.0, "% Positive": 0.72}]}
